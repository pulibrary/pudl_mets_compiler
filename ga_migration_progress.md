# Fail

 * pudl0030 - Chinese Block Prints: From Gest, no Voyager Records
 * pudl0031 - Jackson Prints: Problems due to merged VRA records that are
              separate in Voyager, e.g. 2007.2195-97, 2007.2198-99,
              2007.02211-12 and more. Propose merging Voyager records to match.
 * pudl0035 - Blake...probably wouldn't be hard to get this done.
 * pudl0082 - A Japanese sugoroku: This is almost certainly 10636676, just needs
              to be ingested manually.
 * pudl0083 - Merged records similar to Jackson (e.g. 2012/00018_19)
 * pudl0130 - GA treasures - various problems.

As records are added/corrected, add them to the mapping file
`vis_voy_mapping.json`. Don't change the existing entries, just add new ones so
the the PUDL identifiers still work (e.g. add `"2007.2195-97": "12345678",`) for
the first merged Jackson Prints record, assuming we agree that we can do that.
