PUDL METS Compiler version 0.0.1.

1. How to build
From the root directory of the project (the one that contains "pom.xml") call

me@my:{root}$ mvn clean assembly:assembly

If the build is successful, a target directory will be created. Is should
contain. among other things, a jar file called 
mets-compiler-jar-with-dependencies.jar

2. How to run
The aforementioned jar file is executable, so
me@my:{root}$ java -jar target/mets-compiler-jar-with-dependencies.jar

There is also a shell script, run.sh, in the root of the project that wraps
this command.

3. Configuration
Each time the application is executed, it looks for a file called 
"localProps.xml" on the classpath.  If this file can not be found, it will be
created and the application will exit:

"A file called localProps.xml has been created in this directory. Please update 
it and run again."

Edit that file and run again. Paths may be absolute (safest) or relative to the 
project root directory.

This file can be edited before each run to facilitate
compilation of different projects.  The comments in the file should explain
the function of each property.

Note that calling `mvn clean` will delete the target directory, localProps.xml, 
and the application log.
